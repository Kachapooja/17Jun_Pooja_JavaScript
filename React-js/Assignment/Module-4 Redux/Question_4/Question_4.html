<!--What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is
its purpose?
   
  In the context of web development using React, the setState function is used to update the state of a component in a React application. The setState function takes two arguments:

Partial State Update: The first argument is an object that represents the partial state changes you want to make. This object typically contains one or more key-value pairs where the keys are state property names and the values are the updated values you want to set.

Callback Function (Optional): The second argument is an optional callback function that is executed after the state has been updated. This callback function allows you to perform additional actions or side effects that should occur after the state update is complete. The purpose of this callback is to ensure that you're working with the updated state values.
